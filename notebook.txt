I've decided not to implement a complete solution for timestamps. For now, I'll keep the flat structure of phrases
and timestamp events and most consequences with current time. The exception is knowledge, which will get the timestamp
of the earliest phrase in the phrase list.

In practice, whenever we add consequences, whether for events or static knowledge, we give the timestamp of the record, the current
record.

As of now, there is no inferring from the knowledge base of a specific person. So even if John knows that Daryl went to Fiji,
he does not directly infer that Daryl is in Fiji. Instead we use inference from the static db (objective knowledge) to do that

Probably would make more sense to have a centralized step creation mechanism that includes events, inter-person questions, responses etc.
Attach a gens-type, such as stroy-step, knowledge insertion, etc.
